# Introduction

At this point, we have gone through a number of methods for processing spatial data. Many of these were **non-parametric** or **semi-parametric**: this means that it can be difficult to link specific changes in a parameter or covariate to the intended result. In addition, many have been **spatially implicit**: they use coordinates as a proxy for spatial structure rather than modelling some *true space*. INLA can do all these too but is especially powerful for **parametric** and **spatially explicit** models. If you want to conduct inference on your data, then this might be perfect for you!

## Definitions

Before going too deep into the package details, first we need to ensure we're familiar with the language of spatial statistics. The point is not to teach theory (which will mostly be omitted) but to ensure we have a *shared language* when questions arise. If you *are* interested in the theory, there are numerous good [resources](https://www.paulamoraga.com/book-spatial/) out there.[@blangiardo_spatial_2015; @moraga_geospatial_2019; @moraga_spatial_2023] 


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Many of the links, references, and materials came from [Ben Swallow](https://ben-swallow-research.github.io/) during his supervison of my MSc dissertation. The theory and background relied on older slides from [Janine Illian](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/staff/janineillian/). Newer `inlabru` materials came from Finn Lindgren's [2025 `inlabru` course](https://inlabru-org.github.io/inlabruCourseMay2025/index.html).
